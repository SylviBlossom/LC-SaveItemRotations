# SaveItemRotations
Saves the rotations of items on the ship, preventing you from losing the little details of your ship organization. This also includes a bugfix for item rotation being desynced between players when they pick up and drop them.

This requires you to both save and load using this mod, and both the server and client must have the mod for the loaded item rotations to appear correctly.

If you encounter any problems please report the bug either to **sylviblossom** on the Lethal Company Modding discord or [open an issue](https://github.com/SylviBlossom/LC-SaveItemRotations/issues/new).

See also [SmartItemSaving](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SylviBlossom/SmartItemSaving/) for this feature as well as others including correctly loading item positions and preventing corruption of modded item IDs.
